# About dom0ng


- 👋  Hey, I’m JustinY (aka @dom0ng).
- 👀  I'm passionate about technology and constantly exploring how things truly work under the hood.
- 🔭  I’ve spent years delving into game hacking, reverse engineering, and memory analysis, aiming to understand—and sometimes circumvent—obscure or questionable tactics used by certain companies.
- 🌱  I'm a self-taught developer, drawing knowledge from both the internet and 42 School.
I believe the best way to learn is by doing—and occasionally breaking things.
- 👯 I happily stand on the shoulders of giants. Many tools I use are crafted by developers far more skilled than me.
Embracing the "skid" label isn’t a weakness—it's a drive to learn, improve, and contribute back.
I’m always open to collaboration and believe deeply that sharing knowledge benefits everyone.
- 💞️ Special thanks to the open-source community—your code and generosity have been invaluable. Every contribution you’ve made might be the breakthrough for someone like me. There’s a special place in my heart for all of you!

Note :
- 🤔 I don’t reinvent the wheel (yet).
- ⚡ My math and logic aren’t perfect, but I’m always working to improve.
- 😉 **“It’s never too late to learn.”** (Shout-out to a wise friend from Finland.)

I value **truth, transparency, and open knowledge.**
I stand firmly against **propaganda, misinformation, and deceit.**

**Everyone should have access to accurate information online.**
God bless the open-source community.
**SHARING IS CARING.**
