# About dom0ng


- 👋 Hi, I’m @dom0ng / JustinY.
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in technology, discover how stuff/technology really works !
- 🔭  I’m currently playing around with game hacking and memory stuff since years++., trying to get around some shady companies and their shady tactics.
- 🌱 I learn everything i know from internet and 42 School.
- 👯 I still consider myself as a skid, since most of the tools i use are done by others peoples way smarter than me.
  Being a skid is not bad. You will be surprised by what i can do.
- 🤔 I dont reinvent the wheel (not yet).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, i think sharing is caring, and i would like to give a huge thanks to everyone from the open-source community. 
Every code you have ever shared will be useful for someone like me, who always want to learn, they're special place on my heart for you !
- ⚡ My maths and logics are not the bests.
- 🤍 SHARING IS CARING
- 😉 Some guy from Finland told me that **is never too late to learn**.


**I don't like propaganda, disinformation, and lie.**
Everyone should be able to found **true information on internet.**

God bless the open-source community.
